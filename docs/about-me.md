This is a post about me, my interests and what I've done, etc.

#### Why am I pursuing a career in software development? 

I originally graduated in Economics with the intent of going into law because I was interested in working in a field that had a high degree of problem solving. I later discovered, however, that I enjoyed the problem solving in economics a lot more than the problem solving at law school (and beyond). So I decided a different career path was for me. 

Why didn't I pursue a career in economics, then? The reason for that is, during my degree I also took a course in a language that was probably more dead than COBOL: Latin. Holy smokes, did I just use a colon outside of Python üòµ‚Äçüí´? I really enjoyed my time learning the syntax and structure of Latin, and turning that knowledge into new and original pieces of 'opera' (the nominative case of the third declension neuter noun for the word 'work' in Latin ü§ì‚òùÔ∏è). I assumed programming languages would provide a similar feeling of enjoyment.

With those two things in mind, I looked into software development. 

#### What I did after law school

I started by looking at HTML, CSS and JS by following popular <abbr title="Massive Open Online Course">MOOC</abbr>'s online (Udemy, Youtube, etc). The only stuff that I made early on that I didn't delete was stuff that made an impact on other people, mostly the two snippet extensions that I published to MSFT's vscode marketplace (both having a combined ~33,000 installs [1](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Cjay.es6-javascript-snippets), [2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Cjay.ruby-and-rails-snippets)).

Looking back, I realize that the snippet pack stuff was me running into the [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect). "now I know how to write the software, now I just need to write it fast üòé". I continued to look into tools that I thought could make me more productive, and ended up settling on vim and linux. I think these were pretty worthwhile actually. I'm using vim right now to write this post and Linux, although not a productivity tool per se, gave me insight into what was running my web applications.

I switched to Mac eventually (what I use today) because I wanted to learn more about iOS/Android apps (Linux can't develop apple software). Linux was also eating up too much of my time with things like systemD, window management (suckless software), file system stuff, volumes, etc. I should have redoubled my efforts into web development, but I think in the end it made me a better full stack developer. I griefed with Gradle back when it wasn't as good (and still do from time to time on spring), I learned more about the differences in how the UI is constructed on different platforms (activities/fragments, UIKit/Storyboards), and was introduced to other things on the way like clean architecture.

After that I had a stint docker/k8s, a stint with ML/AI where I was doing script kiddy stuff with poor understanding of how models were being trained, then I looked into web3 and built a crowdfunding app called [Pethreon](https://pethreon.cstraka.dev) and [my blog](https://cstraka.dev/). And that leaves me to where I am today. I'm currently building an app called bungle, which

I think I need to look more at design pattern stuff and 

#### Where I want to be in the future

I want to hone my skills and become a competent full stack developer. I'm interested in focusing on cloud native applications and
