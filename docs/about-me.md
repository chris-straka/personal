This is a post about me, my interests and what I've done, etc.

#### Why am I pursuing a career in software development?

I originally graduated in Economics with the intent of going into law because I was interested in pursuing a career that had a high degree of problem solving. I later discovered, however, that I enjoyed the problem solving in economics a lot more than the problem solving at law school (and beyond). So I decided a different career path was for me.

Why didn't I pursue a career in economics then? Because during my degree I also took a course in a language that was probably more dead than COBOL: Latin. Holy smokes, did I just use a colon outside of Python üòµ‚Äçüí´? I really enjoyed my time learning the syntax and structure of Latin, and turning that knowledge into new and original pieces of 'opera' (Latin's third declension neuter noun for 'work' ü§ì‚òùÔ∏è). I assumed programming languages would provide a similar experience and was worth the effort.

With those two things in mind, I looked into software development.

#### What I did after law school

I started by looking at HTML, CSS and JS by following popular <abbr title="Massive Open Online Course">MOOC</abbr>'s online (Udemy, Youtube, etc). The only stuff that I made early on that I didn't delete was stuff that made an impact on people, mostly the two snippet extensions that I published to MSFT's vscode marketplace (both having a combined ~33,000 installs [1](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Cjay.es6-javascript-snippets), [2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Cjay.ruby-and-rails-snippets)).

There's a lot of technical learning that I did from various subjects (iOS/Android, Linux, networking, AI/ML, blockchain), and after spending too much time on that stuff, I decided to redouble my efforts back on full stack web development. I made several projects and scripts that you can view on [my github](https://github.com/chris56974) or [on my blog](/). I'm quite proud of a web3 crowdfunding app that I made called [Pethreon](https://pethreon.cstraka.dev) ([the code for Pethreon](https://github.com/chris56974/pethreon)). 

After difficulty finding work, I decided to get a BS in CS at [WGU](https://www.wgu.edu/). I chose WGU because they followed a competency based model, so students who were already profficient in the material could accelerate quickly through the program. I already knew a lot, and I had transfer credit from my economics degree, so I was able to complete the program in 3 months (Oct 1st 2023 - Jan 10th 2024). I've since applied to [Georgia Institute of Technology's online MS in CS](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/degree-programs/online-master-science-computer-science-oms-cs) where I'll find out if I got in sometime this March 2024 (classes start August 2024). I'm hoping to work full time as I complete it.

#### Where I see myself improving

I have room to improve on a lot of things but these three come to mind.
- Practicing more on implementing design patterns, especially for large scale enterprise applications. 
- Improving my data structures and algorithm skills. My leetcode is not great.
- Getting better at data modelling, ERD stuff, normal forms, etc.

#### Where I want to be in the future

I want to be a senior full stack software engineer building cloud native applications.
