I used a cool trick to make the terminal for this website and I think it's worth sharing.
If you want to find out more about how I made the terminal in its entirety, you can check
out the [source code for my terminal on Github](https://github.com/chris56974/personal-website).

There's only two HTML elements that are meant to take in text from the user,
`<input />` and `<textarea/>`. I needed an element that would allow me to enter
in text that the user couldn't delete (the terminal prompt)
**and** I needed the text to wrap onto the next line like it does in a terminal.

<input
  type="text"
  readonly
  value="It's easy to add text that the user can't delete inside an input element like this one, but it doesn't wrap onto the next line"
  style="width: 100%;"
/>

<br />
<br />

<textarea>The text inside a textarea will wrap onto the next line, but the user is free to delete anything inside of it</textarea>

<br />

To get around both these limitations, I found a [global HTML attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes)
called [contenteditable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/contenteditable).
You have to be weary of accessibility when you use it, and I think it's mostly used for creating your own
[WYSIWYG editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG). But it works wonders for creating your own terminal.

```html
<div>[visitor@mywebsite ~] <span contenteditable></span></div>
```
