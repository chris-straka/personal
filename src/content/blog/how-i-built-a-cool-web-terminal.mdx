I used a cool trick to make the terminal for this website and I think it's worth sharing. If you want to find out more about how I made it in its entirety, you can checkout the [source code for my terminal emulator on Github](https://github.com/chris56974/personal-website).

There's only two built-in HTML elements that are meant to take in text from the user (that I know of), `<input />` and `<textarea/>`. To make a terminal emulator, I needed a way to display some text that the user couldn't delete (the prompt) **and** I needed text from the user to wrap onto the next line like it does normally in a terminal.

<input
  type="text"
  readonly
  value="inputs like this one can't wrap their text content onto the next line (someone can correct me if I'm mistaken)"
  style="width: 100%;"
/>

<br />
<br />

<textarea style="width: 100%; height: 100px;">The text inside a textarea can wrap easily onto the next line, but it's difficult to create a terminal prompt inside the textarea that a user can't delete. I want the user's text to wrap underneath the terminal prompt like it does in a real terminal. Maybe this is doable with JS or something else, but ultimately I decided on this next trick that I learned about</textarea>

<br />

To get around both these limitations, I found a [global HTML attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes)
called [contenteditable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/contenteditable). You have to be careful of accessibility when you use it, and I think it's mostly used for creating your own [WYSIWYG editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG). But it works wonders for creating your own terminal.

```html
<div>[visitor@mywebsite ~] <span contenteditable></span></div>
```
